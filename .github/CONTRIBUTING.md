## Code style

Please make your code look like the other code in the project.

PsySH follows [PSR-1](http://php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). The easiest way to do make sure you're following the coding standard is to [install `php-cs-fixer`](https://github.com/friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer) and run `php-cs-fixer fix` before committing.

## Branching model

Please branch off and send pull requests to the `develop` branch.
